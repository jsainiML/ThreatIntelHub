## CVE-2024-49113: 
Its a critical vulnerability in the Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) that can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. Below are the detailed aspects of this vulnerability:

----
### Description
- **Vulnerability Type:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Affected Software/Hardware:** Windows operating systems utilizing LDAP services
- **Severity:** High
- **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)
- **CVE Link:** https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49113

---

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from an out-of-bounds read in the LDAP implementation, which can be triggered by specially crafted network packets
- **Payloads:** The exploit involves sending specially crafted CLDAP (Connectionless LDAP) packets to the target server1
  
- **Exploitation Steps:**
  1. The attacker crafts a malicious DCE/RPC request to the victim
  2. The victim is triggered to send a DNS SRV query about a specific domain (e.g., SafeBreachLabs.pro)1.
  3. The attacker's DNS server responds with the attacker's hostname and LDAP port1.
  4. The victim sends a broadcast NBNS request to find the IP address of the received hostname1.
  5. The attacker sends an NBNS response with its IP address1.
  6. The victim becomes an LDAP client and sends a CLDAP request to the attacker's machine1.
  7. The attacker sends a CLDAP referral response packet with a specific value, resulting in LSASS crash and forced reboot of the victim server1.
