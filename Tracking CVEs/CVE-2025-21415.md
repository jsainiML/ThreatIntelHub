## CVE-2025-21415:
A high-severity authentication bypass vulnerability in Microsoft's Azure AI Face Service allows authorized attackers to elevate privileges via network-based spoofing attacks, potentially compromising sensitive systems and data.

### Description
- **Vulnerability Type:** Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290)
- **Affected Software/Hardware:** Microsoft Azure AI Face Service (versions prior to January 29, 2025 patch)
- **Severity:** High
- **CVSS Score:** 9.9
- **CVE Link:** https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-21415

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause:** Improper validation of authentication tokens or network identifiers, enabling attackers to spoof legitimate credentials and bypass authentication checks.
- **Payloads:** No public PoC or payload examples are available as of January 29, 20251
- **Exploitation Steps:**
  1. Attacker gains authorized access to the network.
  2. Spoofs authentication tokens or network identifiers.
  3. Sends crafted requests to Azure AI Face Service to escalate privileges.
  4. Accesses restricted resources or executes unauthorized actions15

### Mitigation
- **Patch/Update:**
  - Apply Microsoftâ€™s official patch released on January 29
- **Workarounds:** 
  - Implement network segmentation to isolate Azure AI Face Service.
  - Restrict access using firewall rules to trusted IP ranges
- **Configuration Changes:**
  - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for service accounts.
  - Audit and reduce privilege levels for all users/service principals1


### Detection
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):**
  - Unexpected privilege escalation events in Azure audit logs.
  - Unusual network traffic patterns to/from Azure AI Face Service endpoints
